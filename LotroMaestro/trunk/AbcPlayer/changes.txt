Known Issues
  - Only major and minor keys are supported.

Version 1.1.0
  - Fixed an issue when determining the speed to play songs that have a meter 
    with a denominator that's not 4 (e.g. 6/8). Hopefully all songs should 
    play at the correct speed now.
  - The volmue difference between +ppp+ and +fff+ has been reduced. ABC 
    Player's volume dynamics should now more closely match LotRO's.
  - Fixed the harp's ^a and b notes to no longer sound like clicks.
  - Occasionally when changing instruments, you'd hear the instruments 
    playing at full volume for a few seconds. This should no longer happen.
  - Removed the power of two restriction on the meter's denominator.
