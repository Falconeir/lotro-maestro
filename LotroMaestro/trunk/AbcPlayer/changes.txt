Todo:
  - Separate LotroInstruments.sf2 from the installer. Make it a download.
  - Allow pasting of ABC text.
  - Add support for keys other than major and minor.
  - Tempo slider.
  - ABC visualization.
  - Open multiple copies of one song.

Version 1.1.0
  - Fixed an issue when determining the speed to play songs that have a meter 
    with a denominator that's not 4 (e.g. 6/8). Hopefully all songs should 
    play at the correct speed now.
  - Reduced the volmue difference between +ppp+ and +fff+. ABC Player's 
    volume dynamics should now more closely match LotRO's.
  - Fixed the harp's ^a and b notes so they don't sound like clicks.
  - Occasionally when changing instruments, you'd hear the instruments 
    playing at full volume for a few seconds. This should no longer happen.
  - Removed the power of two restriction on the meter's denominator.
  - ABC Parse "warnings" for notes too low/high/short/long, chords with too 
    many notes, volume +dynamics+ inside chords.
  - ABC Player handles notes with incorrect octave markers (like c,, or A') 
    like LotRO does, rather than giving an error.  The comma always lowers 
    the octave and the apostrophe always raises the octave, regardless of 
    whether the note letter is upper or lower case.
  - You can now change the instrument and see bar numbers even if the abc 
    file is missing the (required) "X:" line at the beginning.
